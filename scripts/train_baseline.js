/**
 * Offline Training Script for NeuralClassifier
 * 
 * Purpose: Generate pre-trained weights to ship with the extension
 * Usage: node scripts/train_baseline.js
 * Output: scripts/model_v1.json (copy to extension assets)
 * 
 * INSTRUCTIONS:
 * 1. Install Node.js if not already installed
 * 2. Run: node scripts/train_baseline.js
 * 3. Copy generated model_v1.json to extension assets
 * 4. Update neural-classifier.js to load from assets as fallback

// TODO: Implement full training script
// This is a template - expand with:
// - Full NeuralClassifier class (copy from neural-classifier.js)
// - Synthetic training data generator
// - Training loop with early stopping
// - Weight export functionality

console.log('🚧 Training script template created');
console.log('📝 Next: Implement full training logic based on neural-classifier.js');

console.log('- Synthetic field data (100+ examples per class)');
console.log('- Training loop (SGD with L2 regularization)');
console.log('- Weight export to JSON');
